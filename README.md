# Iron Software Test

## Old T9 on Phone Thoughts

### This was the first time ever looking at or creating something using c#


* This Project was made with some amount of user experience in mind

* The understanding necessary was basic in terms of general programming

* The amount necessary to learn about c# was a decent amount actually. But I am no longer of the mind that c# should be avoided. It's not too difficult to work with like Java is.

## About The Project
* This is a console application, as it is not a functional programming style like one would do with a GUI it could be a bit haphazard at times.

* The application was made under the .NET version 6.0.16 so if you plan to run it I would recommend using that unless later versions are backwards compatible.

* This app was designed to be easy to use and simple to apply.

* The documentation about individual lines of code are contained within the main document which is named <b>Program.cs</b>
