## Functionality: Requires One To Type From A Keyboard In The T9 Method, Meaning You Are Actually Using Numbers, Not Letters To Generate Text.

### NOTES: 
- This Is A Console Application
- I had never used C# before but I got it done in about 6 hours by looking for syntax etc. online
- I had taken a C++ Course For Credits Before So It Wasn't A Terrible Difference
- I learned that C# is much easier to comprehend than Java
- The understanding necessary was basic in terms of general programming


### This was the first time ever looking at or creating something using c# so I can't tell you much more than using it in general and compiling is just a matter of adding options to the compiler.

## About The Project

* The application was made under the .NET version 6.0.16 so if you plan to run it I would recommend using that unless later versions are backwards compatible.

* This app was designed to be easy to use and simple to apply.

* The documentation about individual lines of code are contained within the main document which is named <b>Program.cs</b>
